Ideas for version 2.0 include:

 * Renaming classes so that they all have an Args prefix to prevent namespace
   collisions. As I have programmed a lot of Go before I didn't realise the
   need for it. 

 * Renaming Lexer to (Args)Tokenizer. This is more correct because unlike a
   lexeme, a token includes its token type, which is accessible through the
   current Lexer class.
